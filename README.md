GestureMe

GestureMe is a mobile application that leverages Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision to enable hands-free control of smart devices using natural hand gestures. Built with Flutter and integrated with TensorFlow Lite and MediaPipe-style hand landmark models, this app allows users to interact with their devices through real-time gesture recognition via the camera.

In this project, I trained and deployed a gesture classification model that recognizes key hand gestures such as an open palm, fist, peace sign, and pointing finger. These gestures are mapped to common device actions like adjusting brightness, changing volume, or moving a cursor—bringing a new level of accessibility and interactivity.

This app demonstrates the practical application of AI in human-computer interaction, particularly for accessibility use cases where touch interfaces may not be viable. It's ideal for smart home environments, AR/VR experiences, or assistive technology.

Key Features:

Real-time gesture recognition using AI
TensorFlow Lite model integration for fast on-device inference
Control device functions like brightness, volume, and navigation
Cross-platform development with Flutter
Targeted for mobile deployment

Tech Stack:
Flutter, Dart
TensorFlow Lite
Camera Plugin
Custom-trained gesture recognition model
MediaPipe-style landmark extraction

Real-World Use Case: GestureMe addresses real-world accessibility and convenience challenges by enabling touchless device control, which is crucial in environments where touch interaction is limited—such as medical settings, smart homes, or for users with motor impairments.
