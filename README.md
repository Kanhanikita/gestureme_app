# GestureMe

**GestureMe** is a mobile application that uses Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision to enable **hands-free control of smart devices** through intuitive hand gestures. Designed with accessibility and interactivity in mind, it allows users to control functions like screen brightness, volume, and navigation using real-time gesture recognition via their device's camera.

Built with **Flutter**, and integrated with **TensorFlow Lite** and **MediaPipe-style hand landmark models**, GestureMe brings seamless gesture-based interaction to mobile platforms.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Real-time Gesture Recognition**  
  Detects and classifies hand gestures like open palm, fist, peace sign, and pointing finger using a custom-trained model.

- **Device Control Integration**  
  Gestures are mapped to common device functions such as:
  - Adjusting brightness  
  - Controlling volume  
  - Navigating or simulating cursor movements

- **On-Device AI Inference**  
  Leveraging TensorFlow Lite for fast and efficient gesture recognition without relying on a cloud connection.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
  Developed using Flutter for smooth performance on both Android and iOS devices.

## üß† Tech Stack

- Flutter / Dart  
- TensorFlow Lite  
- Camera Plugin  
- Custom Gesture Recognition Model  
- MediaPipe-style Landmark Extraction

## üåç Real-World Use Cases

GestureMe tackles real-world accessibility and convenience challenges by enabling **touchless device interaction**, which is especially valuable in:

- Smart home environments  
- AR/VR applications  
- Medical and sterile settings  
- Assistive technology for individuals with motor impairments
